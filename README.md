OH YOU FOUND AN EASTER EGG THIS IS MY PUBLIC DRAFT/JOURNAL FILE. It's like committing, but not pushing IRL.

In the mood for Unsolved Mysteries, I started watching The Code last night. TBH I knew I was about to fall asleep, but heard "mathematician" and "prime numbers" and immediately dozed off. It sounds like something you kids might like to take in before you dose. I say that because I watched someone who's about to become a scientist spend half his trip watching Try Guys a few weeks ago. I'm not saying he didn't have an awesome realization about something, it was just something he wasn't expecting to. 

Back to my bullshit, I'm sitting here, a black cat snoozing at my side, breaking out "The Halloween Tarot" cards next to my hand-formed mug of he worst coffee I've ever had in my life. A candle from a package of ikea tea lights I forgot I had stashed away, as a treat. I put in my contacts today after refraining for most of these months. They are my last pair from when the $4/box over the counter in Amsterdam. Since all I do is FW code. I can still manage navigating outside when it's well-lit. I'm broke, but relatively happy over the pandemic. 
I would kill for a booth at Uncle Bills where I would down at least 3 kitsch mugs of the best worst coffee in town without thinking around this time of year. Always found it surprising that people looked at me like I was a weirdo
Maybe my need to keep moving and shaking was a little bit of a mask, not the kind we're wearing now. I have never minded at all being someone that mainly works, and I mean REALLY works at night when they need to. Then sleeps for 12 hours. I did wake up tired today. The 5 - 6 hour nights do catch up with you.

So, in terms of bifurcating algorithms and thinking about the pivot - is that what Cambridge Analytica used to find their 7% of "persuadables"
